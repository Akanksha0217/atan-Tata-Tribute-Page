    <h3><u>Early life and education</u></h3>
    <p>
      Ratan Tata was born in <b>Bombay </b>(now Mumbai), during the British Raj,
      into a Parsi Zoroastrian family, on 28 December 1937.He was the son of
      <b>Naval Tata</b> (who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata
      family), and <b>Soonoo Tata</b> (the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji
      Tata). Tata's biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata was a member of the
      Tata family by blood. In 1948, when Tata was 10, his parents separated,
      and he was subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his
      grandmother and widow of <b>Ratanji Tata</b>. He had a younger brother
      Jimmy Tata and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second
      marriage to his stepmother Simone Tata and two half-sisters Shireen and
      Deanna Jeejebhoy from Soonoo Tata's second marriage. Tata studied at the
      Campion School, Mumbai until 8th grade.

    <p>
      Tata studied at the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campion_School,_Mumbai"
        >Campion School, Mumbai</a>
      until 8th grade. He then continued his studies at the Cathedral and John
      Connon School in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverdale_Country_School"
        >Riverdale Country School</a>
      in New York City, from which he graduated in 1955. After high school, Tata
      enrolled in Cornell University, from which he graduated with a bachelor's
      degree in architecture in 1962. While at Cornell, Tata became a member of
      the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. In 1975, Tata enrolled in the Advanced
      Management Program at Harvard Business School (HBS). In 2008, Tata gifted
      Cornell $50 million, becoming the largest international donor in the
      university's history. Tata also donated $50 million to Harvard Business
      School, Harvard University to establish an executive center, which is now
      called Tata Hall that supports over 9,000 executive education students

    <h3><u>Career</u></h3>
    <h5>Early years</h5>
    <p>
      In 2004 Tata met architect
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Quincy_Jones">A Quincy Jones</a>
      who spent three weeks as architecture design critic at Cornell. After
      completing Cornell, Tata briefly joined Jones at his firm Jones & Emmons
      in Los Angeles. While Tata was planning to settle in Los Angeles, he was
      called back to India by his grandmother.
    </p>
    <h5>Later years</h5>
    <p>
      In 1991, <b>J. R. D. Tata </b>stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons,
      naming him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the
      heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational
      freedom under the senior Tata's tenure. In response, Tata implemented a
      number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the
      implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to
      the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit to
      building the Tata group brand.He had Tata Tea acquire <b>Tetley </b>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Motors">Tata Motors</a>
      acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and <b>Tata Steel </b>acquire Corus. These
      acquisitions repositioned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a
      global business, with over 65% of revenues coming from operations and
      sales internationally.

    <p>

        "I came close to getting married four times and each time I backed off
        in fear or for one reason or another."</i
      >He was a devotee of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sathya_Sai_Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a
